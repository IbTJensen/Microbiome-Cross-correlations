# Microbiome-Cross-correlations
Repository of code and implementation for the paper "Estimation of cross-correlations involving microbiome communities: A comparison between novel and transformation-based procedures", currently unpublished.

The scripts in the folder "Simulations" were run on a high-performance workstation. Some scripts may require too much memory for most laptops and desktops. Fig 1 is produced by running Fig1_cluster.R and Fig1_loadings.R followed by Construct_Fig1.R. Fig 2 and Fig 4 are procuced analagously to Fig 1.
